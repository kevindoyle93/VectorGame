# VectorGame

This is a twin stick shooter made for an arcade cabinet as an assignment for my OOP module. I was really proud of how this game turned out, and if you have Processing I think its worth a play. Particularly if you have an Xbox controller handy. 

All sounds and music are my own.

I'm leaving the code here (in the master branch) as it was when I submitted the assignment as a record of how far I've come. If you would like to use this code as the basis to a project, or as a way to learn some Processing, please feel free!
